Both cameras produce 2048 pixel square images.  The field-of-view of the IFU camera is 28\" on a side, while
the Rainbow Camera (RC) has a field-of-view that is 13\' on a side that is divided into quadrants for each of
the four filters (``ugri``), which have individual FOVs of 6.5\' on a side.


Exposure Time Estimates
-----------------------

IFU exposure time recommendations for standard stars:

* 10 - 11 mag --> 120s
* 11 - 12 mag --> 240s
* 12 - 13 mag --> 360s
* 13 - 14 mag --> 500s

IFU exposure time recommendations for science targets:

* 15 mag --> 420s
* 16 mag --> 600s
* 17 mag --> 900s
